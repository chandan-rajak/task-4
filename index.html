    <p id="pra1">Success is often seen as the achievement of a goal, but its true meaning goes far beyond accolades or material rewards. It is deeply personal and can be defined in countless waysâ€”whether it's mastering a skill, overcoming adversity, or simply finding happiness and purpose in daily life. True success involves growth, resilience, and the ability to learn from failure. It's not just about reaching the top, but also about the journey, the lessons learned, and the person one becomes along the way. Ultimately, success is most meaningful when it aligns with one's values and brings a sense of fulfillment.
